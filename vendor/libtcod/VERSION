-----------------------------
This is a modified version of above revision. Most notable changes include:
	- sys_sfml_c and GUI part removed completely
	- parser modified to make it compatible with our data files again (new keywords struct, color, etc. have been suffixed with _t to avoid collisions)
	- removed most of the sys functions, thread functions, and DLL init code
	- forced static linkage
	- renamed TCOD_dice_t::nb_rolls back to nb_dices
        - custom rendering modified to render to a buffer and then provide both the buffer and screen to the custom renderer (kind of brittle at the moment, will need to be cleaned up at some point)
